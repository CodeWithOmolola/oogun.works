                        alongside fashion school graduates. This challenges the industry's gatekeeping around who gets
                        shelf space and promotional budgets. This means treating African design philosophies,
                        construction techniques, and aesthetic theories as equally sophisticated as European fashion
                        traditions. Your product descriptions, marketing materials, and buyer presentations would
                        educate consumers about the intellectual depth behind the pieces, not just their visual appeal.

                <p class="case-text-large">Afromodernist principles offer GAP a framework to bridge the gap between
                    market demand and industry reality. By implementing culturally-informed merchandising strategies,
                    GAP can differentiate itself, attract value-seeking consumers, and drive sustainable growth with a
                    potential yield increase of 15 - 25% increase.</p>

                <p class="case-text">This approach transforms retail spaces from transactional environments into
                    cultural discovery hubs, creating meaningful brand experiences that resonate with modern consumers
                    while honoring authentic cultural traditions.</p>
